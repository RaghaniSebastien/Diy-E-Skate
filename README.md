# Diy-E-Skate

This is a diy electric skateboard i designed and built a few years ago with RC-car-modelism parts.

The goal was to learn about e-transportation and also to have fun riding it ! ðŸ˜‰

I made a demonstration and let people testing it at the well known "Maker Faire Paris".

Here's a video of it :
